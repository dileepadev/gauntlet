# Contributing to gauntlet

Thank you for your interest in contributing to [gauntlet](https://github.com/dileepadev/gauntlet)! We welcome contributions, including bug fixes, feature enhancements, documentation improvements, and other general improvements.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository**  
   Fork this repository to your GitHub account. This creates a copy of the repository in your account, allowing you to make changes without affecting the original repository.  
   To fork the repository, click the **Fork** button in the top right corner of this page or click [here to fork the repository](https://github.com/dileepadev/gauntlet/fork).

2. **Clone your fork**  
   Clone your forked repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/gauntlet.git
   ```

3. **Create a new branch**  
   Create a new branch for your changes. Follow the [branch naming guidelines](BRANCH_NAMING_GUIDELINES.md).

   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```

4. **Make changes and commit**  
   Make your changes and commit them with a descriptive commit message. Follow the [commit message guidelines](COMMIT_MESSAGE_GUIDELINES.md).

   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: Add a new feature"
   ```

5. **Push your changes**  
   Push your changes to your forked repository.

   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

6. **Submit a pull request**  
   To submit a pull request:
   - Go to your forked repository.
   - Click the **Compare & pull request** button next to your `your-branch-name`.
   - Add a title and description for your pull request. Follow the [pull request guidelines](PULL_REQUEST_GUIDELINES.md).
   - Click **Create pull request** and remember to add the relevant labels using the [pull request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

## Development Setup

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for environments and packaging. Python 3.12 or newer is required.

```bash
# Install dependencies (creates .venv automatically)
uv sync --all-groups

# Run the test suite
uv run pytest

# Lint, format, and type-check - all three must pass before you open a PR
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format .
uv run mypy
```

CI runs exactly these checks, plus `markdownlint` across all Markdown files, on every pull request.

### Code style

Style is enforced by `ruff`, configured in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) — there is no separate style document to read. Types are checked by `mypy` in strict mode, so new code needs full annotations.

Two conventions the tooling cannot enforce, both of which matter here:

- **Detectors read traces, never model text.** A model can refuse in prose while calling the tool anyway. If a check reads what the model *said*, it is not a detector.
- **Corpus payloads stay inside the safety rules.** They are documented in the [threat model](docs/threat-model.md#safety-rules-for-the-corpus) and are not negotiable.

## Guidelines

- Follow the project's code style.
- Update documentation if necessary.
- Add tests if applicable.
